! The delayed update, composed, must track an immediate one exactly.
!
! Test 36 drives the panel accessors and test 37 drives the panel wrap, each in
! isolation. What neither covers is the two running *together*: a slice in which
! reads, rank-d appends, flushes and vertex conjugations interleave, which is
! what Wrapgr_mod actually does. A Hamiltonian whose Op_V are all diagonal and
! of rank at most 2 -- which is the common case -- never composes the wrap's
! ZSLGEMM arms with an append at all, so this test drives ranks 1 to 4 and both
! diagonalities explicitly.
!
! The arms:
!
!   immediate   an explicit G. Each update is a ZGEMM onto it, each wrap an
!               Op_Wrapup/Op_Wrapdo of it.
!   delayed     G_stale plus panels. Each update is delay_append, each wrap a
!               delay_wrap, and the accessors are read between them.
!
! Both see the same operators, fields, sides and updates in the same order, so
! they must agree: at every step through the accessors, and at delay_close on
! the whole matrix. The wraps are what make this more than test 36 with a bigger
! d -- the identity being checked is
!
!     L*(G_stale + X*Y^T)*R = (L*G_stale*R) + (L*X)*(R^T*Y)^T
!
! applied repeatedly and with appends landing between the conjugations, where a
! panel that was wrapped the wrong number of times, or in the wrong order
! against a flush, gives a plausible wrong answer rather than an obvious one.
!
! Requires ALF_DELAY_K in the environment; CMake sets it. Without it delay_alloc
! is a no-op and every assertion here would pass vacuously, so the test refuses
! to run rather than reporting success.
