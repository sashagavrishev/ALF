! The panel accessors must reconstruct the Green's function exactly.
!
! delayed_update_mod holds G = G_stale + X*Y^T and never forms it. Three
! accessors serve everything the vertex update needs:
!
!   delay_block(P,d)  the d x d block G(P,P)
!   delay_row (P,d)   d rows,    row(i,l) = G(P(l), i)
!   delay_col (P,d)   d columns, col(i,l) = G(i, P(l))
!
! Each is compared here against an explicitly formed G_stale + X*Y^T. A whole-run
! comparison would catch an error in any of them too -- the chain diverges
! immediately -- but it cannot say which, and it cannot reach the edges: an empty
! panel, a panel one append short of the flush threshold, and the partial panel
! left at delay_close. Those are what this covers.
!
! Requires ALF_DELAY_K in the environment; CMake sets it. Without it delay_alloc
! is a no-op by design and every assertion below would pass vacuously, so the
! test refuses to run rather than reporting success.
