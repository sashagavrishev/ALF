# The delayed update must walk the same Markov chain as the immediate one.
#
# Tests 36 to 38 drive delayed_update_mod's own routines. What they cannot
# reach is Upgrade2's delayed branch, which links those routines to the
# Woodbury chain: the reconstructed rows feed v, the reconstructed columns feed
# the rank-d update, and a mistake there produces a plausible chain rather
# than an obviously wrong one.
#
# Here a sampler is run twice on each parameter set, once with the delay off and
# once with it on, from the same seeds. We require the auxiliary field
# configuration left behind to be identical. Up to Metropolis near-ties the
# two schemes accept exactly the same updates, so this is an equality and not a
# tolerance. An HDF5 build writes confout_0.h5 instead of confout_0; two such
# files holding identical data still differ byte-for-byte (HDF5 tracks
# per-object timestamps by default), so that variant is compared
# dataset-by-dataset with h5diff rather than cmp. Without h5diff on the PATH
# that comparison cannot be made, and the model is reported as skipped rather
# than failed: a missing tool says nothing about the delayed update.
#
# Usage: delayed_vs_immediate.sh <ALF.out> <source dir> <work dir>
