# Log of backward compatibility changes and critical bugs

### 2026-09-02 NBin and CPU_MAX are both bounds
Author: A. Gavrishev <br>
Fork-local: proposed as [#648](https://github.com/ALF-QMC/ALF/pull/648) and closed, since
discarding `NBin` when `CPU_MAX` is set is deliberate upstream behaviour.

Previously when a non-zero `CPU_MAX` was set, any `NBin` setting was discarded outright. Now, both are simulation bounds and the run stops at whichever is reached first; this makes the use of checkpoint restarting when limited by wall-time easier as it is straightforward to set an overall bin count target that simulations must eventually reach. `NBin <= 0` keeps the purely time-bounded behaviour.

A run that sets both `NBin > 0` and `CPU_MAX > 0` and previously relied on `CPU_MAX` switching the Nbin target "off" must now explicitly
set `NBin = 0`.

The `info` file now reports both bounds, adding a `Bins` or `No bin-number limitation` line. Any
code that parses `info` by line position rather than by key has to be slightly adapted.

### 2026-08-29 Optional delayed (rank-$k$) Green's function updates
Author: A. Gavrishev <br>
[GitHub](https://github.com/ALF-QMC/ALF/pull/646)

The sequential local update can now hold the Green's function in the
factored form $G = G_{\rm stale} + X Y^T$ across one time slice, batching the
rank-$d$ corrections of successive accepted updates into a single level-3 flush. See
Sec. "Delayed (rank-$k$) updates" in the ALF documentation.

By default, the delayed update scheme is disabled. Enabling it requires setting the environment
variable `ALF_DELAY_K` to the desired delay depth. With the rare exception of Metropolis near-ties
(which have yet to be observed in benchmarks), where numerical precision differences between delay depths can
cause branching at the accept / reject stage,
delayed updates (at any depth within reason) should reproduce the same Markov chain.

We also ship an automatic delay probe which runs at the start of the Markov chain triggered by `ALF_DELAY_K` being set
to `auto`: this performs an extremely short-lived synthetic micro-benchmark to determine the best delay depth for the model and
compute environment combination.

The `info` file now shows `Delay depth` and `Delay depth from`. Any code that parses `info` by
line position rather than by key has to be adapted due to these two new lines.

### 2026-01-28 factors of pi in analytical continuation

In the file Green, produced by the MaxEnt wrapper,  the real part of G is now multiplied by a factor -1/pi. 

### 2026-01-27 Intel ifx compiler without `-heap-arrays 1024`
Author: J. Schwab <br>
Merge request [!234](https://git.physik.uni-wuerzburg.de/ALF/ALF/-/merge_requests/234) | [GitHub](https://github.com/ALF-QMC/ALF/issues/564)

The Intel compiler ifx is no longer used with the option `-heap-arrays 1024`,
since it produces some kind of memory leak.
As a result, lager arrays have to be allocated to avoid a stack overflow. 
This applies e.g. to the variable `GRC` in the subroutine `Obser`.

## ALF 2.6
ALF 2.6 released on 2025-11-05

### 2025-09-29 Renaming Delta_S0_global to Get_Delta_S0 global
Author: J. Hofmann <br>
Merge request [!213](https://git.physik.uni-wuerzburg.de/ALF/ALF/-/merge_requests/213) | [GitHub](https://github.com/ALF-QMC/ALF/issues/296)

The function `Delta_S0_global` has been renamed to `Get_Delta_S0_global` as the new function now returns $\Delta S_0$ instead of $\exp(\Delta S_0)$. In case your model is using global moves, we advice to adapt your code accordingly. A fallback to `Delta_S0_global` is used for the time being such that backward compatibility is maintained

#### Optional changes
1) Modify and rename your implementation of `Delta_S0_global`

### 2024-07-10 Fix: Lattice in data.h5: Mixup of Norb and N_coord
Author: J. Schwab <br>
Merge request [!204](https://git.physik.uni-wuerzburg.de/ALF/ALF/-/merge_requests/204) | [GitHub](https://github.com/ALF-QMC/ALF/issues/534)

The lattice quantities `Norb` and `N_coord` were mistakenly mixed up in the HDF5 results file `data.h5`.
This has been fixed and the script `Analysis/fix-latt.py` was added to repair existing result files.

### 2024-02-01  Implement new  function  $(F,A) = \int d \omega F(\omega) A(\omega)$ in the stochastic maxent.
Author:  F. Assaad <br>
Merge  request [!196](https://git.physik.uni-wuerzburg.de/ALF/ALF/-/merge_requests/196) | [GitHub](https://github.com/ALF-QMC/ALF/issues/526)

1. Function F  is included in  parameter  list  of  the  stochastic maxent  routine


### 2024-01-25    Both  Classic MaxEnt  and  Stochastic  analytical continuation are  available <br>

Author:  J.Schwab and F. Assaad   <br>
Merge requests: [!190](https://git.physik.uni-wuerzburg.de/ALF/ALF/-/merge_requests/190) | [GitHub](https://github.com/ALF-QMC/ALF/issues/520) and [!194](https://git.physik.uni-wuerzburg.de/ALF/ALF/-/merge_requests/194) | [GitHub](https://github.com/ALF-QMC/ALF/issues/524)

1. Both  approaches  allow  to  specify a  default model

2. To toggle  between the  Stochastic  and Classic approaches  a  new  logical variable,   Stochastic, has  been  introduced  in  VAR_Max_Stoch  name  space.  The  default  value  is Stochastic=.True. such that the  code  functions as  in the previous  releases.

3. There  is a  new  channel index  available P_PH for  single  particle  Green  functions  that are   particle-hole  symmetric. 


### 2023-08-14 Hubbard Stratonovich fields have been updated to be complex

Author:  F. Assaad <br>

1. `Fields\_mod.F90`
    1.  `sigma%f`       is now complex    rather than real

2. `Hamilton\_main\_mod.F90` 
      1. `Hamiltonian\_set\_nsigma\_base(Initial\_field)`: `Initial\_field`  is  now complex, not  real 
      2. `Delta\_S0\_global\_base(Nsigma\_old)`: `Nsigma\_old`  is  complex  rather  than real 
      3. `S0\_base(n,nt,Hs\_new)` : `Hs\_new` is  now  complex rather  than real
      4. `Global\_move\_tau\_base` : The array `Flip\_value` is  now  a  complex one-dimensional array

Merge request [!117](https://git.physik.uni-wuerzburg.de/ALF/ALF/-/merge_requests/117) | [GitHub](https://github.com/ALF-QMC/ALF/issues/449)

#### Breaking changes
1) Parameters to be formulated in format for parsing as described in Sec. 5.6 of documentation.
   Strictly speaking, it's not necessary to do that, but it simplifies the Hamiltonian,
   since the subroutine for reading parameters and writing parameters to HDF5 will be written automatically.
2) With HDF5: Add typebound procedure `write_parameters_hdf5` to Hamiltonian.
